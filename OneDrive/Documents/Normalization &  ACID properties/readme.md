# Normalization & ACID Properties in Databases

This project contains notes and examples on **Normalization** and **ACID properties** ‚Äî key concepts in relational database design and transaction management.

## Overview

### Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This project covers:
- 1NF (First Normal Form)
- 2NF (Second Normal Form)
- 3NF (Third Normal Form)
### ACID Properties
ACID stands for:
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed or none at all.
- **Consistency**: Guarantees that the database remains in a valid state before and after transactions.
- **Isolation**: Prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.
- **Durability**: Ensures data persists after a transaction is committed, even in case of a system crash.

Includes notes on:
- Application in DBMS
- Impacts on performance and reliability
- Limitations and disadvantages
