# NORMALIZATION IN DATABASE
## Introduction
Normalizatin is a technique used to organise data into databases. It is a systematic approach to remove the data redundancy and also improves data integrity.


It involves dividing a large table into smaller , more manageable pieces based on functional dependencies among attributes, ensuring that data anomallies are minimized.
Normalization is commonly used for two purpose   
- Remove data redundancy.
- Ensuring data dependencies of proper.


Without data normalization anomallies occur and it becomes difficult to handle and Update data . To understand these i'll take anexamplle using a table,
|ID    | Name    |Address   | Subject     |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 201  | Akshay  |  Hamas   |  Biology    |
| 202  | Charu   |  Baha    |  Math       |
| 203  | Disha   |  Baziah  |  English    |
| 204  | Eva     |  Figi    |  French     |
- Apdation Anormally-To update address of a students who accur twice or more than twice you are required to **update** Address column in all the rows, else data will become inconsistent.
- Insertion Anormally-Suppose for a new admission, we have a Student id, name and address of a student but if student has not opted for any subject yet then we have to insertNULL there, leading to Insertion Anamoly.
- Deletion Anamoly â€“ If id 401 has only one subject and temporarily he drops it, when we delete that row, entire student record will be deleted along with id.

## Normalization Form:
Normalization is mainly devided into 3 normal forms.
- First Normal Form 
- Second Normal Form
- Third normal Form
### First Normal Form 
in normal form normalization no two rows of data must contain repeating data i.e.,Whenever we search for a particular resulpt the multiple column connot be used to fetch the same row.

Table should be organised into rows, each row should have a primary key that distinguishes it as unique.

consider this a not a 1st normal form
|firstname  |  age   |   subject   |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
|Amos       | 19     | maths       |
|Alex       | 20     |maths&english|
|John       | 18     | english     |
|Moses      | 21     | french      |

now transformed to first normal form
|firstname  |  age   |   subject   |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
|Amos       | 19     | maths       |
|Alex       | 19     | maths       |
|Alex       | 20     | english     |
|John       | 18     | english     |
|Moses      | 21     | french      |
using first normal form, data redundancy increases, as there will be many columns with the same data in multiple rows as a whole will be unique. 

### Second Normal Form
In second normal form there must be not any partial dependency of any column on primary key .it means tha for a table that concatenate primary key,each column in the table that is not part of the primary key must depend upon the entire concatenated key for its existence.
- Meet all requirements from first normal form
- Eliminate subsets of data that apply to multiple rows and place them in a seperate table
- create a relationship between new tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys.

### Third Normal Form
- Relation is **3NF** if it is in **2NF** and it contains no transitive dependencies.
- Considerrelation R containing A,B and C.R(A,B,C)
-If A to B and B to C then A to C
- Transitive Dependency: three attributes with the above dependencies
